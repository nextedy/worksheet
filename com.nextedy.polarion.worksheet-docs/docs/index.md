## Maximize team capacity

Check a live breakdown of team allocation in real-time, including the capacity and availability of every engineer. Find out if you are not overloading your team and determine needed capacity at a glance.

## Assign work records with ease

Assign work records to a team. Plan and manage work items in easy to use interactive interface. Team members can also plan their week directly in the Worksheet view.

## Export to Excel

The solution is using Polarion Work Records for both: 

* to assign (ie. plan) the items to a particular day in a future 
* and to report the work done in a particular day. 

As a result, you can use the built-in Polarion capabilities to export data to Microsoft Excel.

## How does it work?

### Setup your team

The team item holds the information who works in a team, with what capacity. You can also specify what are the 'Work Items Collections' the team is supposed to work on.

### Manage Records

Create work records either through the Polarion interface or directly from the Nextedy WORKSHEET interface.
